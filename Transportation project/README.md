## üìö What I Learned:
### General Learnings:
- Integrated and analyzed multiple data sources to drive insights.
- Enhanced organization of measures by consolidating them into a single table and organizing further into folders for improved manageability.
- Created a custom dashboard background using simple tools like PowerPoint for a clean and professional design.
- Discovered helpful shortcuts such as:
  - **Windows + .** to insert emojis and use them for bullet points.
  - **Ctrl + Shift + L** to edit multiple locations simultaneously.

---

### üìà TOP Performing Metrics:
- Utilized `RANKX` to rank Top 5 and Bottom 5, combining it with `IF` to display only the highest and lowest performers.
- Created a parameter field with values for Top 5 (1) and Bottom 5 (0) to enable custom slicers.
- Developed dynamic strings using `IF` and `SELECTEDVALUE` to display either "Underperforming" or "Top Performing" based on the parameter selection.

### üöª Passengers By Gender:
- Displayed gender distribution using simple card visuals, filled and empty boxes (via emojis) to represent percentages.
- Calculated gender percentages by using `DIVIDE` and `CALCULATE` to filter total passengers by gender.
- Set up visuals with a total of 10 icons:
  - Filled icons represent the calculated percentage (e.g., for male passengers),
  - Empty icons are the remainder.

### ‚è∞ Peak Hours Occupation:
- Created a table that captures peak hours for riders using `SUMMARIZE`, combining columns from different sources such as `time` from the Ridership table and a calculated column for rider type (e.g., Professional).
- Solved for highest peak hours using `TOPN` in descending order for occupation, providing actionable insights.

### üé® Format Color Manipulation:
- Learned how to dynamically assign colors using hex codes based on percentage thresholds, enhancing the visual clarity of data.
- CF (Age_group, Occupation, Route) using color "#f09383" once pass 19%.

### üëµ Age Bucket for Riders:
- In this particular visualization, I learned that stacked charts can be used to make a custom Data Label.
  - Using a Blank Measure, giving it a value of 300 made the size of the bottom chart.
  - Manipulated the Data Label to print out the bucket Range and Percentage for each bucket.

![DAX Code for Age Buckets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28652bec-ac2f-4040-92cb-c5b4234b42de)

</details>

- Created a custom age grouping column using the `FLOOR` function to categorize riders into age ranges, grouping all ages above 70 as "70+."
- Defined bucket ranges:
  - **Bucket Start**: E.g., If age = 37, it will be floored to 30.
  - **Bucket End**: If age > 70, display "+"; otherwise, display start + 9 (e.g., 37 will become 30-39).
- Combined the ranges using `CONCATENATE` for display purposes.

### üöè Route & Occupation by Riders:
- Discovered how bar charts can be enhanced by creating custom headers using a blank measure.
- Used the blank measure in the x-axis to act as a dynamic label, manipulating strings using `CONCATENATE` for more intuitive visuals.
